    "#### Steps\n",
    "1. **Directory Creation**:\n",
    "   - Creates the directory `./datasets/supervised` to store the supervised dataset.\n",
    "2. **Data Splitting**:\n",
    "   - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets with an 80-20 split if the files do not already exist.\n",
    "   - Saves the splits as `train.csv` and `test.csv`.\n",
    "3. **In-Context Example Creation**:\n",
    "   - Formats each row of the training dataset as a question-answer pair.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Question: CVE:Description of a vulnerability?\n",
    "     Answer: CWE-ID:Description of the weakness.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "4. **Joining Examples**:\n",
    "   - Joins the examples with `---` as a separator for better readability and context during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outputs\n",
    "- **Training and Testing Splits**:\n",
    "  - `train.csv` and `test.csv` saved in `./datasets/supervised`.\n",
    "- **In-Context Examples**:\n",
    "  - Printed question-answer pairs formatted for supervised learning."

      "CVE:An IPSec configuration does not perform integrity checking of the IPSec packet as the result of either not configuring ESP properly to support the integrity service or using AH improperly. In either case, the security gateway receiving the IPSec packet would not validate the integrity of the packet to ensure that it was not changed. Thus if the packets were intercepted the attacker could undetectably change some of the bits in the packets. The meaningful bit flipping was possible due to the known weaknesses in the CBC encryption mode. Since the attacker knew the structure of the packet, they were able (in one variation of the attack) to use bit flipping to change the destination IP of the packet to the destination machine controlled by the attacker. And so the destination security gateway would decrypt the packet and then forward the plaintext to the machine controlled by the attacker. The attacker could then read the original message. For instance if VPN was used with the vulnerable IPSec configuration the attacker could read the victim's e-mail. This vulnerability demonstrates the need to enforce the integrity service properly when critical data could be modified by an attacker. This problem might have also been mitigated by using an encryption mode that is not susceptible to bit flipping attacks, but the preferred mechanism to address this problem still remains message verification for integrity. While this attack focuses on the network layer and requires an entity that controls part of the communication path such as a router, the situation is not much different at the software level, where an attacker can modify tokens/parameters used by the application.?\n",
